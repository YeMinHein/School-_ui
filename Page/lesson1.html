                <p>As a spy, his personality is very cold and efficient for his job, doing whatever it takes to complete
                    the mission, from joining terrorist organizations to dating his target's daughter to becoming a
                    father. However, he is shown to have a kind personality as shown when he rescued Anya Forger, even
                    risking his identity as a spy.</p>
                <p>
                    Loid's past as a powerless war orphan, feeling despair and isolation, has seemingly stuck with him
                    into his adult years and becomes his motivation as a spy to create a world where children wouldn't
                    have to cry. He sincerely empathizes with Yor Forger about sacrificing themselves for the sake of
                    others and their beliefs, becoming the deciding factor for Yor's decision to marry him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Contrasting his current personality and profession as a spy, he was an honest child and rarely lied
                    to his parents. When he did lie to his father to trick his father into giving him pocket money to
                    buy a soldier set, he quickly felt guilty for lying, almost confessing to his father immediately
                    afterwards, and wishing to work for money to pay his father back. After his dad's disappearance
                    during the Ostanian raid of his hometown, he felt even more guilty about his lie and vowed to tell
                    his father the truth when he would return.

                <p>
                    Twilight has been trained to be a spy for at least ten years amount of time. His style of fighting
                    seems to be very much on the pragmatic side of combat, using everything in his environment to his
                    advantage.
                </p>
                <p> <b>Intelligence:</b>  Twilight's greatest weapon is his intelligence and observation, given his line of work,
                    by using flour to stop armed men from shooting and remembering various secret ciphers to decipher
                    his next missions. He is also able to remember the individual names of over 200 penguins, simply by
                    skimming over a list and their dietary habits, as well as remembering Yor from several potential
                    wife candidates having even remembered enough to know her life's history, He also remembered all
                    contents of the Ostanian Intelligence manual word-for-word, easily seeing through Yuri's cover
                    story.</p>
